# Reading Helper

Reading helper is a open-source tool, that will help you to track your readings, register your books all in your local machine so you can manage it.

The idea of creating this tool was that people that like to read usually have it's books on pdf format (at least in my case), I always had troubles following my lecture after a couple of days of weeks, sometimes I forgot what page I was or if I annotated that on a notepad, I forgot to update that because it was very manual.

So with the help of reading helper GUI and features you can have all that things associated with your personal account and your own database.

The goal of Reading Helper is to manage your books and all that essential information in one place.
