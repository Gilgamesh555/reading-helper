# Phases of Reading Helper

## First Phase

To begin with probably the best is to design Reading Helper with minimal features, focusing in functionality and trying to have a deliverable to users as soon as possible. for that purpose the development process will be divided in the following.

- [] Create the initial GUI for the project
  - [] The GUI will let the user update its books (pdf for now)
  - [] Will have a reading viewer mode, so user can read in the app
  - [] Feature of save current page for reader (so user can back later and go where he was even if he close the session)
- [] Create a Docker container so user can save its own data in the app local machine (pdf's, data about his profile).
  - [] User can save its books.
  - [] User can save data about its books (if he already read it, or which page he's already is)
- [] User should be able to install the Tool on its local (Reading Helper) without much configuration or knowledge about docker or web-apps.

For now user will need to install the dependencies manually (docker, node) probably. any suggestion or ideas are welcome just put an issue or contact me.
